title: The title asks for 2.6 GB immediately after mounting its save content
status: open
symptom: out of guest heap 0x40000000: wanted 0x9f000000 bytes, right after 'content default_checkpoint_sav mounted as save:'; the allocation fails and the title carries on

Appeared the moment saves started working, and it is on a path that was
previously unreachable: XamContentCreateEx used to return "device not
connected", so the title never got as far as this allocation.

TWO EXPLANATIONS TRIED, THE FIRST ONE WRONG.

I first assumed I had caused it by reporting the host's real disk capacity in
XamContentGetDeviceData -- a PC's terabytes where a console would report tens of
gigabytes -- and that the title sized a buffer from it. Capping the device to
512 MB (the console's own Memory Unit) did NOT remove the allocation. So the
size does not come from the device data, and that explanation is dead.

The cap stays anyway, on its own merits: reporting a number no console could
return is asking a title to handle a case it was never written for, and 512 MB
is far more than a save needs. But it is not a fix for this.

WHAT IS ACTUALLY KNOWN: the request is for exactly 0x9f000000 bytes
(2,667,577,344), type 0x20001000, protect 0x4, immediately after the content
mount. The guest heap has ~460 MB free and refuses. The title does not treat the
refusal as fatal -- the run continues at 29.4 fps with rendering and audio
normal -- but a subsystem that just asked for 2.6 GB and was told no is unlikely
to be in the state it thinks it is in, and this is the most plausible reason no
save file has ever appeared on disk.

WHAT TO LOOK AT NEXT: which call site makes the request. The same technique that
worked for the pure-virtual investigation applies -- NtAllocateVirtualMemory can
report its link register, which names the caller, and from there the size's
origin is readable. Do that before guessing a third time.

DO NOT "fix" this by growing the guest heap until the allocation succeeds. A
title that genuinely wants 2.6 GB on a 512 MB console is a title being asked a
question we got wrong somewhere upstream, and making the number fit would hide
it.
