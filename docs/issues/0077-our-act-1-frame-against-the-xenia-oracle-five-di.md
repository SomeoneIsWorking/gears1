title: Our Act 1 frame against the Xenia oracle: five differences
status: open
symptom: our in-game frame is missing the character and HUD, windows are flat grey blocks, vertical streaking, lifted blacks

The first oracle-backed comparison of an in-game frame, both sides headless and
driven from the SAME scripted walk (`tools/oracle_compare.sh`): our renderer via
its own filmstrip, Xenia via `tools/xenia_oracle`.

WHAT KIND OF COMPARISON THIS IS. Two separate emulations at matching wall-clock
offsets, NOT frame-synchronised, so a pixel metric between them is meaningless
and none is quoted. Both frames show the same Act 1 wall from very nearly the
same camera -- same three windows, same moss line, same wall panel -- which is
what makes the differences below readable.

  ours:   scratch/oracle/compare/ours/frame_06300.ppm  (~210 s in)
  theirs: scratch/oracle/compare/theirs/frame_0210s.png

FIVE DIFFERENCES, most severe first:

1. NO CHARACTER. Marcus is absent from our frame. This is a third-person game;
   the player character is in frame during all gameplay, so this is not a camera
   difference.
2. NO HUD. The oracle draws the ammo counter and weapon icon; ours has neither.
   That 1 and 2 are BOTH missing is the interesting part -- both are late passes,
   which points at our frame ending before them or dropping them, rather than at
   two unrelated faults.
3. WINDOWS ARE FLAT GREY BLOCKS. The oracle shows sky, bars and light shafts
   through each window; ours fills them with uniform light grey.
4. VERTICAL STREAKING across the image, strongest on the right.
5. LIFTED BLACKS / LOW CONTRAST, and this one is measured rather than eyeballed:
   ours mean 30.3, 6,711 distinct colours, 95.1% of pixels above 8/255; theirs
   mean 22.1, 24,497 colours, 75.8%. Ours is brighter with a THIRD of the colour
   variety, which is the signature of a flattened tonemap rather than of a
   different moment.

NOT YET DIAGNOSED. Recorded so the next session starts from the observation
rather than from a fresh playthrough. The obvious first question is whether 1
and 2 share a cause with the project's existing note that the presented surface
is chosen by rule when the guest's front buffer names no resolve destination.

### Note (2026-08-05)
## Confirmed in-game, so this is not a "different moment" (2026-08-05)

The first reading to rule out was that our run simply had not reached gameplay --
a menu or attract camera would explain a missing character and HUD without any
renderer fault. It has:

  [draw] frame: 639 of 849 draws issued, 0 skipped; 107 distinct shader pairs,
         275 distinct shaders, 254 pipelines; 990 texture bindings (934 guest
         textures, 56 from the rendered RT); 886987/921600 px non-black (96.2%)

849 draws with 107 shader pairs is the Act 1 deferred pipeline, not a menu (a
menu frame in the same run is 177 draws / 23 pairs). Our frames alternate
~690-720 and ~235-265 draws issued, which is the predicated tiling pattern.

Also ruled out: the PRESENTATION CHOICE. The log says "presenting surface 0x2d0,
chosen by the guest's front-buffer address (front buffer 0xa0311000)" -- so we
are presenting the surface the guest itself named, not a rule-of-thumb fallback,
and the missing passes are missing from the buffer the guest points at.

The 210 draws not issued are mostly accounted for by the tiling collapse ("184
replayed draws and 2 resolves dropped"), which is by design; ~24 are not
accounted for by that line and nobody has looked at what they are. That is the
first thing to check next, because "the character's draws" is exactly the shape
of a couple of dozen draws that quietly do not reach the backend.

### Note (2026-08-05)
## CORRECTION: there are no unaccounted draws (2026-08-05)

The note above ended by pointing at "~24 draws the tiling-collapse accounting
does not explain ... the right size for a character pass". That was arithmetic
done across two different frames' log lines, and it is WRONG.

Checked properly on one frame, replaying courtyard.gfr offline:

    552 issued + 174 dropped by the tiling collapse + 18 resolve draws = 744

which is exactly the frame's draw count. Every draw is accounted for. Nothing is
quietly failing to reach the backend, and the next session should not go looking
for it.

So the character and HUD are missing for one of two reasons, and the arithmetic
cannot tell them apart:
  (a) the guest never submitted those draws in this frame, or
  (b) they were issued and rendered nothing visible -- wrong transform, culled,
      degenerate, or written into a surface we do not present.

The offline loop is what makes this cheap to pursue: `frame_replay` on
scratch/frames/courtyard.gfr reproduces the symptom in about fifteen seconds
(same wall, no character, no HUD, two of three windows flat grey, and the image
pillarboxed inside a black border), so no further playthroughs are needed.
