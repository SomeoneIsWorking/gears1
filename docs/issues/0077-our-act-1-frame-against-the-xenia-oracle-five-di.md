title: Our Act 1 frame against the Xenia oracle: five differences
status: open
symptom: our in-game frame is missing the character and HUD, windows are flat grey blocks, vertical streaking, lifted blacks

The first oracle-backed comparison of an in-game frame, both sides headless and
driven from the SAME scripted walk (`tools/oracle_compare.sh`): our renderer via
its own filmstrip, Xenia via `tools/xenia_oracle`.

WHAT KIND OF COMPARISON THIS IS. Two separate emulations at matching wall-clock
offsets, NOT frame-synchronised, so a pixel metric between them is meaningless
and none is quoted. Both frames show the same Act 1 wall from very nearly the
same camera -- same three windows, same moss line, same wall panel -- which is
what makes the differences below readable.

  ours:   scratch/oracle/compare/ours/frame_06300.ppm  (~210 s in)
  theirs: scratch/oracle/compare/theirs/frame_0210s.png

FIVE DIFFERENCES, most severe first:

1. NO CHARACTER. Marcus is absent from our frame. This is a third-person game;
   the player character is in frame during all gameplay, so this is not a camera
   difference.
2. NO HUD. The oracle draws the ammo counter and weapon icon; ours has neither.
   That 1 and 2 are BOTH missing is the interesting part -- both are late passes,
   which points at our frame ending before them or dropping them, rather than at
   two unrelated faults.
3. WINDOWS ARE FLAT GREY BLOCKS. The oracle shows sky, bars and light shafts
   through each window; ours fills them with uniform light grey.
4. VERTICAL STREAKING across the image, strongest on the right.
5. LIFTED BLACKS / LOW CONTRAST, and this one is measured rather than eyeballed:
   ours mean 30.3, 6,711 distinct colours, 95.1% of pixels above 8/255; theirs
   mean 22.1, 24,497 colours, 75.8%. Ours is brighter with a THIRD of the colour
   variety, which is the signature of a flattened tonemap rather than of a
   different moment.

NOT YET DIAGNOSED. Recorded so the next session starts from the observation
rather than from a fresh playthrough. The obvious first question is whether 1
and 2 share a cause with the project's existing note that the presented surface
is chosen by rule when the guest's front buffer names no resolve destination.
