## Current focus

S006 is the current focus. Gears 1 is the only active title. The repository now consumes
the pinned `x360port`/Xenia execution boundary for an asset-free synthetic discriminator
and now owns a profile-authenticated normalized-image-to-flat-guest adapter. The shared
checked XEX2 inspector and real ignored-image identity path are verified, but the product
still refuses the gameplay target until the remaining import bindings and runtime services
are composed. The executor will prefer dynarec and may use the bounded, counted
fallback; fallback coverage cannot prove gameplay compatibility or performance.

## Capability details

### S001 — exact title identity

Evidence: `config/titles/gears1.toml`, `tools/title_identity.py`, and the
title-identity tests fail closed on container and normalized-image hashes.

### S002 — bounded provisioning

Evidence: GDF extraction, archive bounds, and identity are tested. The shared checked-XEX2
inspector now validates the real ignored Gears 1 container and produces the exact
profile-authenticated normalized image consumed by the adapter. Gap: the inspector and
runtime-service composition are not wired into `./run.sh`; complete install validation and
product provisioning still refuse to launch until the full runtime path exists.

### S003 — executor-independent native rendering

Evidence: focused native frame, draw, resolve, resource, and shader tests build
without a CPU executor. Gap: no live Xenia-fed native frame exists.

### S004 — native audio mix

Evidence: `runtime/titles/gears1/audio_mix.*` owns the independently authored
kernel and known address `0x825F2D40`. Gap: dispatch and differential
qualification through `x360port` are missing.

### S005 — native GPU ticket wait

Evidence: `runtime/gpu_ticket_wait.*` and `runtime/wait_probe.*` retain the host
synchronization contract. Gap: guest-address dispatch through `x360port` is
missing.

### S006 — Xenia-backed execution

Evidence: `test_gears1_dynarec_boundary` consumes exact shared-runtime and Xenia
revisions, maps an aligned authenticated synthetic image whose code and entry
point use the retained Gears leaf address, and crosses JIT to typed import to
native code. The pinned shared runtime also now exposes and tests image-scoped
native override, scoped original-call, exact-entry invalidation, and
title-neutral device-memory callback contracts. It validates title-reported
executable-write ranges and now automatically observes virtual writes to the
authenticated code range, exits an active translated call after a watched guest
store, invalidates touched cached functions before the next guest entry, and
preserves unrelated translations. The shared runtime also bounds translated
basic-block execution across nested guest calls and returns typed exhaustion and
invalidation results. A host import can refuse explicitly; the translated call
exits with its library, ordinal, and reason while incrementing a refusal count,
rather than continuing with an invented return value. The pinned Xenia fork now
routes compiled direct and indirect guest calls through invalidatable entries;
the shared synthetic regression modifies a leaf and observes its new result
through a previously translated caller. This does not yet route those calls to
title-owned native overrides.

`runtime/gears1_guest_image.*` now consumes
the shared PE layout owner and seals a flat guest module after exact normalized-image
profile authentication. The shared checked-XEX2 inspector also validates the real ignored
container, normalized image, import manifest, and helper-pattern evidence. Gap: wiring
authenticated full-image loading into the product, reason-labelled interpreter
fallback, title-specific write/cache-control semantics, and product service
composition remain missing.

### S007 — first Gears discriminator

Evidence: the synthetic Gears-addressed module executes through Xenia's JIT and
calls a typed `DbgPrint` binding; the pinned shared runtime separately proves
the native override/original-call dispatch seam against a synthetic guest leaf.
A maintained headless discriminator authenticates the profile-matching ignored
image, maps its PE sections into guest virtual offsets, allocates and initializes
a caller-owned guest object and variable-import storage through `x360port`,
invokes a retained real-image function-import thunk through the same manifest,
and executes real leaf `0x82233668`: it returns `0x5`, the native override
calls the real original once, and reported executable-write invalidation restores
the original path. The production `Gears1GuestImage` adapter now authenticates
the same normalized image and import manifest; its synthetic CTest and real
ignored-input discriminator pass. The shared checked-XEX2 inspector provides the
container, normalized image, 236 logical imports under the correctly indexed
`xam.xex` and `xboxkrnl.exe` entries, and eight helper-pattern hits.
The first real-image function-import thunk reaches its title callback and now
returns `ImportServiceRefused` for an unsupported service; all
real-image variable imports resolve into bounded caller-owned guest storage.
The title-owned `XGetAVPack` binding for `xam.xex` ordinal 971 executes through
its real thunk and returns the configured AV-pack value. The real
`XamInputGetState` ordinal 401 thunk consumes the retained Gears input owner's
coherent remote-pad snapshot through shared `x360port` XAM serialization. The
headless ignored-XEX discriminator verifies all 16 guest bytes, a connected
null-pointer query, the one-local-user policy, disconnection clearing stale
state, and typed refusal of an unmapped state pointer. The asset-free remote
input test preserves packet and source-arbitration behavior. The real
`XamInputGetCapabilities` ordinal 400 thunk now reports the title's virtual-pad
capability policy as a checked 20-byte guest record; the headless discriminator
also proves disconnected zeroing, null-pointer bad arguments, and typed refusal
of unmapped memory. The superseded direct-memory handlers were removed. Gap:
vibration output and the remaining title-specific service/device semantics, plus
the complete product launch path, remain unimplemented.

### S008 — bounded interpreter fallback

Missing capability: permit fallback only after compilation failure, an
unsupported guest instruction, or unsafe generated host code, with every
transition and executed block reason-labelled and counted. Explicit interpreter
mode remains diagnostic-only. The pinned Xenia CPU tree currently exposes x64/A64
dynarec backends but no CPU interpreter implementation, so there is no existing
fallback to select or account for; the proper owner is the maintained Xenia fork.

### S009 — representative gameplay

Missing capability: reach and independently compare representative interactive
Gears 1 gameplay through the current product. Prior title evidence is migration
input, not a current gameplay result.

### S010 — Apple Silicon A64

Missing capability: qualify A64 code emission, executable memory,
instruction-cache coherence, host ABI, exceptions, and packaging on Apple
Silicon macOS.

### S011 — Android A64

Missing capability: qualify A64 code emission, executable memory,
instruction-cache coherence, host ABI, lifecycle, and APK packaging on Android
`arm64-v8a`.

### S012 — complete native RHI

Missing capability: bypass guest command construction through the native RHI
and prove frame parity. Existing native pieces do not establish that result.

### S013 — native renderer budget

Missing capability: sustain and document an 8.33 ms / 120 fps native-renderer
budget during representative gameplay on named hardware.

### S014 — later Gears titles

Missing capability: qualify exact revisions of Gears 2, Gears 3, and Judgment
after Gears 1 compatibility and performance gates complete.

### S015 — generated guest-source product absent

Evidence: the build graph, launcher, tests, tools, and docs contain no generated
guest corpus, function map, offline CPU translator, or selectable old product.
The migration-boundary gate checks prospective first-party paths.

### S016 — shared UE3/Xbox contract

Evidence: the pinned public `shared/x360ue3` revision provides title-supplied
ABI/binding-schema validation plus object/resource/frame lifetime and semantic
RHI ordering contracts. Gears consumes it in `test_gears1_ue3_contract` with
positive and controlled-negative cases. Gap: the contract is not yet composed
with the authenticated real-image runtime and native RHI backend.

### S017 — native/JIT boundary CI

Evidence: the immutable workflow defines the Gears-owned production-boundary
discriminator for Linux x86-64, Windows x86-64, and macOS arm64. It also executes
the exact/clean dependency and bootstrap contracts, and the canonical C++ quality
owner formats maintained source and lints the built first-party discriminator.
The canonical `tools/verify_dynarec_boundary.py --x360port-root ../../shared/x360port
--expected-machine x86_64` gate uses the exact `x360port` and Xenia revisions
pinned by CMake and the workflow. It passed all seven CTests locally with Clang
on the pinned `x360port` revision `6b1682121143961fb12e9ea057dea2a6128cf78b`
with Xenia `7d99c864c939c09eb43ed32e763087a73875bd40`; the headless
real-image import/leaf discriminator passed separately against the ignored
user-supplied XEX, resolving 236 imports and executing the retained real leaf,
scoped original, and executable invalidation. Gears consumes the shared
driver-aware warning owner;
production CMake selection and real Clang/clang-cl probes accept modern C++ and
reject an unused parameter. That ownership change preserved every native compile
command, and the focused boundary and quality CTests passed afterward. Xenia's
standalone portability suite stays disabled in this consumer; its framework owns
that separate gate. This is synthetic native/JIT mechanism evidence, not Gears
gameplay conformance.
Gap: hosted qualification remains pending, including the known Windows tabulate
portability fix awaiting a fork-publication decision. Android remains absent
because no APK/runtime owner exists.
