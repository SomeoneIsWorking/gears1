# RE Frontier — the ordered RE dependency chain toward a faithful BL2

Tracked by `tools/re_frontier.py` (consult it FIRST; update it in the SAME commit
that changes a step). This is the fine-grained companion to `docs/codemap.md`:
the codemap says *what subsystem exists*, this says *which ordered RE step is
real reverse-engineering vs a hack that jumped ahead*.

**Hard rule (no hacks / no fallbacks):** a `⛔ hack` status is DEBT, never an
acceptable resting state. It marks a shortcut standing in for absent RE and MUST
be removed as its real mechanism lands. `re_frontier.py hacks` is the debt list;
`re_frontier.py next` tells you the next RE-ready step.

**`re-verified` MEANS FAITHFUL to the real target — not "the mechanism runs."** A
step is `re-verified` only when its OUTPUT matches the real game/binary (look /
sound / behavior) on real data. An internal trace ("bytecode reached the call
site", "N rows attached") is a mechanism check, NOT faithfulness — if it runs but
the result doesn't match the real target, it is `re-partial` with the
faithfulness gap named. The user observes the running system; that observation
overrides any internal trace.

**Fail fast & loud:** a failure must surface loudly, never silently fall back —
unless the fallback IS intended behavior of the real target being reproduced.

Statuses: ✅ re-verified · 🟡 re-partial (honest gap) · 🔬 in-progress ·
⛔ hack (debt, must remove) · ⬜ todo · ➖ skip-by-design · ⏸ blocked (computed).

## gpu

### cmd-processor — PM4 command processor executes the ring
- status: re-verified
- deps: 
- evidence: runtime/vd_null_gpu.cpp; executes TYPE0/IB/DRAW_INDX/fences/predication/IM_LOAD; verified 30fps 20000+ frames
- where: runtime/vd_null_gpu.cpp
- gap: 
- notes: 

### shader-xlate — Xenos microcode -> SPIR-V translation
- status: re-verified
- deps: cmd-processor
- evidence: xenia_gpu/ island; 38/38 runtime-bound shaders pass spirv-val, reverified independently
- where: xenia_gpu/, tools/xenos_translate
- gap: 
- notes: 

### shader-capture — Capture runtime-bound shaders at IM_LOAD
- status: re-verified
- deps: cmd-processor
- evidence: catalog #21; 38 distinct payloads, stable across runs, captured at PM4 IM_LOAD
- where: runtime/vd_null_gpu.cpp
- gap: 
- notes: 

### present — Host swapchain present driven by guest VdSwap
- status: re-verified
- deps: cmd-processor
- evidence: runtime/gpu_present.cpp; present 1:1 with guest swap over 8190 frames; headless falls back
- where: runtime/gpu_present.cpp
- gap: 
- notes: 

### const-capture — Track SET_CONSTANT: ALU-float/fetch/bool-loop constant files
- status: re-verified
- deps: cmd-processor
- evidence: catalog #23; at the hot-pair DRAW_INDX the ALU float file decodes to a real transform (c0-c3 identity + c4/c5 -1.209 screen scale, matching the hot VS's own c0-c3 usage) and the fetch file to 3 well-formed textures (1280x720 tiled RT + two 640x360); reproducible across runs. Bases (0x4000/0x4800/0x4900/0x4908) match Xenia register_table.inc + command_processor.cc.
- where: runtime/vd_null_gpu.cpp (TrackConstantLoad, DumpConstantFiles); GEARS_CONST_DUMP=1
- gap: 
- notes: This title feeds ALU-float + fetch constants via plain TYPE0 register writes (already handled), NOT ring SET_CONSTANT type-0/1 (0 over 950 frames). What WAS being dropped and is now handled: LOAD_ALU_CONSTANT 0x2F (type-0 ALU-from-memory, ~12/hot-pair-draw) and SET_CONSTANT 0x2D type-4 REGISTERS (~38/draw); SET_CONSTANT2/SET_SHADER_CONSTANTS never fire. The hot VS's vertex fetch constant IS present in the fetch file at draw time (draw-params RE-VERIFIED this): fetch constant #95 at reg 0x48BE = 0x00097813 (type 3, vertex base 0x97810). The earlier "0 type-3 constants" was a scanner artifact -- the slot-based dump only scans j-entries of slots whose leading dword is type 3, and #95 is at j=2 of slot 31 (leading dword #93 not type 3). The vfetch base was in the register file all along; catalog #22's instruction patch supplies the stride+const-index, not the base.

### draw-params — Detect hot pair at DRAW_INDX and capture draw params
- status: re-verified
- deps: shader-capture, const-capture
- evidence: Captured a representative hot-pair (vs_5363d074/ps_501ac5d8) DRAW_INDX on a real run (GEARS_DRAW_CAPTURE=1, scratch/draw-params/hot_draw.txt). Packet decoded per Xenia (pm4_command_processor_implement.h ExecutePacketType3Draw + registers.h VGT_DRAW_INITIATOR/VGT_DMA_SIZE): VGT_DRAW_INITIATOR=0x00060804 -> prim_type=triangle_list, source_select=kDMA(indexed), index_size=int32, num_indices=6; VGT_DMA_BASE=0x978d0, VGT_DMA_SIZE num_words=12 swap_mode=2(k8in32). GEOMETRY SOURCE RECOVERED from the fetch register file: the hot VS's vfetch reads vertex fetch constant #95 (Xenia disasm "vf0" == 95-storage_index; spirv-dis confirms fetch_constants[0][47][2..3] = fetch-file dwords 190,191 = reg 0x48BE/0x48BF), which at draw time = 0x00097813 0x100000c2 -> type 3 (vertex), base 0x97810, size 192 bytes; baked Stride=12 dwords (48 bytes). COHERENCE (all cross-consistent): indices 0 1 3 0 3 2 = two triangles of a quad, max index 3; vertex buffer size 192 bytes = exactly 4 vertices (indices 0..3 in range); vertices are a clean NDC full-screen quad (-1,1)(1,1)(-1,-1)(1,-1), z=0 w=1; vertex buffer 0x97810..0x978d0 abuts the index buffer at 0x978d0 (contiguous). This is the full-screen RT-sampling pass predicted by system-constants.
- where: runtime/vd_null_gpu.cpp CaptureHotDraw + ReadGuest32Raw (GEARS_DRAW_CAPTURE=1, GEARS_DRAW_CAPTURE_ANY drops hot-pair filter, GEARS_DRAW_CAPTURE_DIR); report scratch/draw-params/hot_draw.txt
- gap: none for the hot pair. Minor open detail: VGT_DMA_SIZE.num_words=12 gives Xenia length 48 bytes vs 24 for 6 int32 indices; num_indices=6 is the authoritative draw count either way. Immediate-index (kImmediate) and kAutoIndex paths not exercised by this draw (both handled/reported by the capture if they occur).
- notes: CORRECTION to const-capture/#23: the fetch file DOES hold the vertex fetch constant at draw time (#95, type 3) -- the earlier "0 type-3 constants" was a scanner artifact (the slot-based dump only entered its j-loop for slots whose LEADING dword was type 3; #95 sits at j=2 of slot 31, whose leading dword #93 is not type 3, so it was skipped). The vfetch base was in the register file all along; the catalog #22 instruction patch supplies stride+const-index, not the base.

### system-constants — Port Xenia SystemConstants + UpdateSystemConstantValues
- status: re-verified
- deps: const-capture
- evidence: tools/system_constants produces the 528-byte xe_uniform_system_constants UBO from a real hot-pair register snapshot (scratch/bin/regfile_hotpair.bin; scratch/bin/system_constants.bin + scratch/logs/system_constants.txt). Layout verified byte-exact against the bound shader's SPIR-V: every OpMemberDecorate Offset of %XeSystemConstants in vs_5363d0746b3ef666.spv matches the C++ struct (flags@0, ndc_scale@16, ndc_offset@32, texture_swizzled_signs@64, ..., texture_integer_scale_bits@400, size 528). Field values consistent with a 1280x720 D3D target: ndc_scale=(1,-1,1) [Y-flip from YSCALE=-360], ndc_offset=(1/1280,1/720,0) [D3D9 half-pixel], vertex_base_index=0, color_exp_bias=(1,1,1,1), zpd_fsi_counter_index=UINT32_MAX. flags=0x3c20 (WNotReciprocal | DepthFloat24 | alpha=kAlways) from the register snapshot; with the draw-params-measured VGT_DRAW_INITIATOR=0x00060804 (prim_type=triangle_list) injected, flags=0x3c60 (+PrimitivePolygonal) -- scratch/bin/system_constants_complete.bin, the definitive value.
- where: tools/system_constants/main.cpp (derivation, ports UpdateSystemConstantValues non-FSI path, reuses Xenia draw_util::GetHostViewportInfo); runtime/vd_null_gpu.cpp DumpConstantFiles (register-file snapshot, GEARS_CONST_DUMP). Optional at configure time (GEARS_HAVE_XENOS_TRANSLATOR), links xenia_gpu, headless-safe.
- gap: none for the register-derived / geometry fields. STUBBED (visibly, reported by the tool): texture_swizzled_signs / texture_swizzles / textures_resolved / texture_integer_scale_bits (texture-cache state, not geometry); vertex_index_load_address / vertex_index_endian + PrimitivePolygonal/PrimitiveLine flag bits (draw-parameter state -- VGT_DRAW_INITIATOR/DRAW_INDX not yet mirrored into our register file; draw-params owns it). All edram_*/FSI fields correctly zero on the non-FSI host-render-targets path.
- notes: ndc_scale[0]=0.99999994 (not exactly 1) is Xenia's ArchReciprocalRefined, reproduced faithfully. VGT_DRAW_INITIATOR is a register (0x21FC) the tool already reads, but our command processor does not mirror the DRAW_INDX packet into it (draw-params owns DRAW_INDX). draw-params measured 0x00060804 (triangle_list) for this same draw; pass `--draw-initiator=0x00060804` to inject it -> flags 0x3c20 becomes 0x3c60 (+PrimitivePolygonal). The clean permanent fix is for the DRAW_INDX handler to mirror VGT_DRAW_INITIATOR into the register file; that belongs to draw-params, not here.

### draw-backend — First real draw: hot pair geometry into swapchain
- status: todo
- deps: shader-xlate, present, draw-params, system-constants
- evidence: 
- where: 
- gap: shared-memory SSBO, 4 constant UBOs, 1x1 stub texture0, render pass into swapchain, one pipeline from the 2 SPIR-V modules. Shaders read geometry from SSBO via vfetch, NOT Vulkan vertex input -- confirmed: hot VS declares only gl_VertexIndex as Input.
